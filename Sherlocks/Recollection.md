## Identify the Correct Profile:
- Use the imageinfo plugin in Volatility to identify the correct profile. The first suggested profile is usually accurate. From the results, determine that the operating system is Windows 7.
- The imageinfo plugin also provides the creation time of the memory dump, specified in the Image Date and Time header.
## Analyze Clipboard Data:
- Use the clipboard plugin in Volatility2 to identify data saved on the clipboard. If the first data shown appears obfuscated, it may indicate the obfuscation mentioned in the questions.
- To verify if this is the copied command, use the cmdscan plugin to check commands executed by the powershell.exe process.
## Verify Executed Commands:
- From the cmdscan results, confirm that the command was executed in both CMD and PowerShell, validating the copied command as relevant.
- Identify the targeted PowerShell cmdlet using the consoles plugin to check the result of the executed obfuscated command. If the result is iex, it stands for Invoke Expressions, indicating the attacker tried to set an alias for the Invoke Expression cmdlet.
## Analyze CMD History:
- Review CMD history to identify attempts by the attacker to exfiltrate the content of Confidential.txt to pass.txt in the pulice directory. Note that the exfiltration failed due to a missing program path.
- Further analyze terminal history to identify encoded messages. After decoding, determine the full path of the readme file.
## Check Hostname:
- To check the hostname in Windows, run net users. From the terminal history, identify the hostname as USER-PC.
- Alternatively, dump the registry key to check the machineâ€™s hostname. First, find the offset of \REGISTRY\MACHINE\SYSTEM using the hivelist plugin. Then, dump the registry key using the printkey plugin.
## Identify User Accounts:
- Use the hashdump plugin to identify the total user accounts on the machine. Conclude from the results that there are three registered users.
## Locate Files:
- Use the filescan plugin to identify the full location path of passwords.txt.
- Analyze the results of the consoles plugin to identify an executable file with a hash-like name. Verify if it is malicious by checking its hash value on VirusTotal.
## Verify Malicious Files:
- If the executable file is identified as malicious on VirusTotal, check the imphash value in the details tab.
- Use VirusTotal to verify the creation time of the malicious executable file.
## Identify Local IP Address:
- Use the netscan plugin to identify the local IP address of the machine. From the results, determine that 192.168.0.104 is the local IP address, as it listens to 0.0.0.0.
## Identify Parent Process:
- Use the pstree plugin to list all processes and their child processes. Conclude from the results that cmd.exe is the parent process of powershell.exe.
## Analyze Browser Activity:
- If the attacker used a browser to log into social media, dump the memory of the browser executable file. From the pslist results, identify that Microsoft Edge was used.
- Dump the browser memory using the memmap plugin. Then, search the .dmp file for .gmail.com using strings. Identify the Gmail account and URL-encoded data. Decode the URL to confirm that mafia_code1337@gmail.com was used for login.
